I+2.0.f nf/uk apply IODD 7 changes in DDDB
I+2.0 nf/mp apply IODD 6 changes in DDDB
I+2.0 mp/mp test 2.0 API for AATSR products
I+2.0 mp/uk translate german in changelog
I+2.0 mp/uk make UNIX shared libraries for IDL API
I+1.2 nf/uk in epr_init_api: check if dddb path is valid, if not log
            the problem so that users can solve it by themselves
I+1.2 nf/uk provide a hint in the example source code and README.txt, 
            that users have to explicitly pass the DDDB path to epr_init_api 
			or set the environment variable EPR_DDDB_HOME. 
			The DDDB path is normally "$EPR_C_API_INSTALL_DIR$/dddb" and
			is NOT automatically set.
I+1.2 nf/nf provide (or adapt?) version of the API itself in epr_api.h
I+1.2 nf/uk write README.txt
B+1.2 uk/uk remove double type decl. in epr_api.h
B+1.2 uk/uk replace 'prep_to_show' in all makefiles with proper target names
I+1.2 uk/uk check correct english spelling in docu/strings 
I+1.2 uk/?? implement support for ASAR products
I+1.2 uk/uk also log the file which is about to be opened in 'epr_open_file',
            before (!) the feared file-not-found error can occur
